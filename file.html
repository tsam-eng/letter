    <h4>Dear Fatimoh</h4>
    <p><strong>JESUS LOVES YOU</strong></p>
    <P>THAT IS WHY </P>
    <P>You are such a beautiful and wonderfully made creature</P>
    <p>God took His time, energy and breath to make you</p>
    <p>He created you for a purpose that you can never imagine in your realm of thought</p>
    <p>he said <strong>'The thought i have towards you is good and not of evil'</strong></p>
    <p>I know you have a religion you so much belief in</p>
    <p>but I am not talking religion but life, truth and way</p>
    <p>beyong you serving God; He made you a king over all he created</p>
    <p>come to think of all creatures God commanded us to govern on on this earth; they dont only serve us but live life as Gods plan on earth for them</p>
    <p>same thing to you</p>
    <p>dont forget i said God has a plan for you before giving you to your parent</p>
    <p>have you find out?</p>
    <P> If you dont mind what i am about to tell you that you are a king that is created by GOD to rule on earth</P> 
    <p>you are a chosen generation that surpose to show Gods excellent to creature</p>
    <p> they are waiting for your manifestation <strong>Fatimoh</strong></p>
    <p> destinies are waiting for you to rise up and take up the responsibility of your calling</p>
    <p> dont be surprise you are getting this from me o</p>
    <p> My motive is to see God work in you</p>
    <p> He said i should tell you that He will heal you, take away all your fears and rebrand you</p>
    <p> You need to do something to make all His plans for you to manifest</p>
    <p> do you know there is enjoyment in christ Jesus</p>
    <p> Yes there is indeed</p>
    <p> If only you will allow me show them to you</p>
    <p> let me tell you this litle story before i end it all today </p>
    <p> when God created man,</p>
    <p> they disobayed GOD, they sinned,So God have to send they away from the garden of aden, where they dont struggle to eat nor sick but do somethings to keep them busy into the world of struggle, sickness and death.</p>
    <p> However, this is not Gods plan for them but because they have failed Him (God) he punished them and caused them</p>
    <p> So our earthly fathers too does, when we disobayed them, they usually ask us why and if there is no reason for it, they will punish us.</p>
    <p> you will agree with me that after punishment, they will love to call us back because is not that they want us to suffer but becasue we have done contrary to their will, they have to</p>
    <p> same thing to this story, after Gods punishment to Adam, God want us back to Himeself because he loves us</p>
    <p> That is why he sent His son Jesus to us</p>
    <p> HOW IS Jesus THE SON oF God?</p>
    <P> I CAN EXPLAIN IF YOU WILL PERMIT ME</P>
    <P> WHY DO JESUS HAVE TO DIE TO SAVE US FROM SIN</P>
    <P> I WILL EXPLAIN IF YOU WILL ALLOW ME TO</P>
    <P> Back to what i am saying</P>
    <P> You need Christ to fulfil all this your dream</P>
    <p> you are not a slave but a son and a kind, you are ment to rule</p>
    <P> Just belief what i am saying </P>
    <p> belief in JESUS</p>
    <P> Belief he died for your sins</P>
    <p> belief he died and rose again: this is for a reason</p>
    <p> confess all your past sins to Him</p>
    <p> AND SAY: LORD JESUS COME INTO MY LIFE, SAVE ME, MAKE YOUR SPIRIT COME TO LIFE IN ME</p>
    <P> IN JEUS NAME. Amen</P>
    <p> I am using this medium to invite you to church on Sunday. WILL YOU COME? DROP YES ON YOUR WHATSAPP TO KNOW IF YOU READ MY MESSAGE</p>
